Project 1 consists of a webpage dedicated to the research of different kinds of peanuts. HTML, CSS, and JS were used to create easy-to-navigate webpages with animated background, hamburger menu, navigation sidebar, and banners. 

Hyperlinks are created upon answering the peanut question on peanutgallery.html and the hyperlinks lead to 1 of 4 peanut pages (runner.html, virigina.html, spanish.html, and valencia.html). For convenience, a hyperlink that leads back to index.html (referred to as "Home") is also provided. 

The 4 peanut pages consist of a short fact relating to the peanut type, a hyperlink that returns the user to peanutgallery.html, a hyperlink easter egg that is safe for work, and a hyperlink that leads to more information about the peanut type(provided by "How Gardening Works"). 

At anytime, the hamburger menu may clicked to access the navigation sidebar, which provides a directory of all the available webpages styled with a hover effect.
