Project 3 consists of a simple todo list that I have named "Simple Peanut List". This the early stages of a shopping list I will be implementing into my Project 2 and making it into my final project.

The list is able to add entries by typing in the peanut name and either pressing "add" or using the "enter" key. Once the entry is made, it will show below the text input field. 

To remove entries, hover over the entry until it glows pink. When the entry is clicked, it will be deleted from the list.
