Project 2 consists of an authentication page that leads to the peanuts index.html when user is authenticated. New background has been added. Log in button has a green hover effect. Made minor changes to peanutgallery.html input boxes and renamed all peanut page titles.

Login.html will check if input boxes are empty. If there are values within the box, the user will be authenticated. 

Upon authentication, a cookie will be searched with the email entered. If no email is found in the list, a new cookie will be set. If an email is found, a welcome back alert will be presented to the user. 

Once cookie is set, user will be sent to the landing page, index.html.
